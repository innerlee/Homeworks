The abstract should first state the problem you want to solve and drawbacks of existing approaches in a very brief way. Then it should state key steps of your proposed algorithm with \textit{clear} motivations and/or observations. This part is the majority of your abstract. Finally, some highlight experiment results should be shown here. Try to avoid using citation and equation here.
