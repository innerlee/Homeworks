\section{Problem 3}~\label{sec:prob3}

For one neuron at the output pooling layer of network (a),
it correspond  to $2\times 2$ size of the second convolution layer,
which correspond to $4\times 4$ size of the first convolution layer,
which correspond to $9\times 9$ size of the input layer.
So the receptive field is $9\times 9$.

For one neuron at the output convolution layer of network (b),
it correspond  to $3\times 3$ size of the pooling layer,
which correspond to $9\times 9$ size of the first convolution layer,
which correspond to $13\times 13$ size of the input layer.
So the receptive field is $13\times 13$.
