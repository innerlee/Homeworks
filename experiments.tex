\section{Experiments and Visualization} \label{sec:exp}

To answer the questions raised in previous section,
we specially designed toy problems in low-dimensions,
so that we can visualize what happens in the training dynamics of GAN.
We use \emph{fully connected} layers as the building blocks for both
the generator and discriminator.
After each fully connected layer,
we add a \emph{batch normalization} layer and a \emph{Elu} activation layer.
Both the latent space and the data space is
restricted to $1$-dimension or $2$-dimension.
Across all experiments,
we use fc networks with
$20-40-100-200-200-100-40-20$ hidden neuron numbers
as the structure for generator.
The same hidden neuron setting is also applied to the discriminator.
The capacity of these networks is large enough for our experiments.
