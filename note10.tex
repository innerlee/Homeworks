\subsection{Prelude}

\subsubsection{Recall}

In the past lectures,
we focused on regularized loss minimization problems that have
non-convex loss functions and/or non-convex regularizations.
By stipulating that the loss function satisfies RSC and that
the regularizers is not ``too non-convex'',
we essentially turned the problem into a convex one,
for which standard techniques apply.

\subsubsection{This Lecture}

In this lecture,
we depart from the regularized loss minimization problem and
consider another quite different estimation problem:
the \emph{phase synchronization problem}.
In this problem,
one is interested in recovering a collection of phases $\{e^{i\theta_k}\}$
based on noisy measurements of relative phases $\{e^{i(\theta_j-\theta_k)}\}$.
Specifically,
let
\begin{equation}
    z^*\in T^n\triangleq\{w\in\cpx^n:|w_1|=\cdots=|w_n|=1\}
\end{equation}
be the unknown phase vector we wish to recover.
We have noisy measurements of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:probj}
    C_{jl}=z_j^*\bar z_l^*+\Delta_{jl},\quad 1\le j<l\le n,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_{jk}$ is the noise associated with the $(j,k)$-th measurement.
To recover $z^*$,
it is natural to formulate the following least squares problem,
\begin{equation}
    \hat z \in\argmin_{z\in T^n}\sum_{1\le j<l\le n}|c_{jl}-z_j\bar z_l|^2.
\end{equation}
Using the fact that $|z_j\bar z_l|^2=1$ for any $z\in T^n$,
the above is equivalent to
