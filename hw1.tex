\begin{align}
    d^2 (f\circ\varphi)\bigg(\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j},\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\bigg)
        &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^j\partial y^i}f\circ\varphi \\
        &= \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^k}\circ\varphi\frac{\partial \varphi^k}{\partial y^i} \\
        &= \sum_{l=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^l\partial x^k}\circ\varphi\frac{\partial \varphi^l}{\partial y^j}\frac{\partial \varphi^k}{\partial y^i}
