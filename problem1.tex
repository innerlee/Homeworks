\section{Problem 1}

\subsection{} %1

Since the solid cone $\cQ^3$ is closed, convex,
and rotational symmetric along the first axis ($t$ axis),
we only need consider a small set $S$ of candidate points
when trying to find the projection of a point $y$ into this set $\cQ^3$.
This is because the point projected to must be unique
and thus we can eliminate points that have `brother/sister' points which
shares the same distance to $y$ due to symmetry.
Specifically, we can choose $S$ be the (or a) plane that contains
both the point $y$ and the first axis.
The problem then reduces to a simple two-dimensional geometry problem
of middle school level (Figure~\ref{fig:1}).
We can directly write down the solution as specified in the question.
