\subsection{Problem Independent Bound} %2.1

For UCB1, we have proved the \textbf{problem dependent bound}
\begin{equation}
    R\le 8 \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} \bigg(~\frac{\ln n}{\Delta_i}+\Delta_i\bigg).
\end{equation}
There are also \textbf{problem independent bounds}.

\begin{thm}[Problem Independent Bound of UCB1]
    \begin{equation}
        R\le\cO(\sqrt{kn\ln n}).
    \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We already know that
    \begin{align}
        E[T_i(n)]
            &\le \frac{8\ln n}{\Delta_i^2} + \cO(1).
    \end{align}
    Then,
    \begin{align}
        R
            &= \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} \Delta_i E[T_i(n)] \\
            &\le c_1 \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} \Delta_i \sqrt{E[T_i(n)] \frac{8\ln n}{\Delta_i^2}} \\
            &= c_1 \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} 1\cdot \sqrt{8 E[T_i(n)] \ln n} \\
            &\le c_1 \sqrt{8 K \ln n \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} E[T_i(n)] } \\
            &= \cO(\sqrt{kn\ln n}).
    \end{align}

\end{proof}
