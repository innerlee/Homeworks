\subsection{Problem Independent Bound} %2.1

For UCB1, we have proved the \emph{problem dependent bound}
\begin{equation}
    R\le 8 \sum_{i:\Delta_i>0} \bigg(~\frac{\ln n}{\Delta_i}+\Delta_i\bigg).
\end{equation}
There are also \emph{problem independent bounds}.

\begin{thm}[Problem Independent Bound of UCB1]
    \begin{equation}
        R\le\cO(\sqrt{kn\ln n}).
    \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}
