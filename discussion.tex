\section{Discussion}

From the experiment results,
we can see that
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solving the problem using LP requires lots of time.
        and it is infeasible for large scale problems.
        In our experiments, we were forced to truncate the dataset
        to a small scale (20000 rows) due to this limitation.
    \item The preparation time for the sketching is negligible in
        experiments.
        This is different from HW1.
    \item The performances of the two sketching methods are similar.
        Increasing the number of rows sampled helps imporve performance.
        We can get a reletive error of $0.58\%$
        by sampling $2.5\%$ of all rows.
    \item Time consumption of sketching methods is extremely small.
        This makes it suitable for large scale dataset.
\end{itemize}
Therefore sketching methods is very useful for large scale problems.
